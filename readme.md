# Demo for Nico Nico Douga HTML5 player with controls

[Demo site here](https://vocaloid.eu/vocaloid/nico-player/).

## Overview

Nico Nico Douga (NND) is a video streaming service. Recently NND added a new HTML5-based embeddable player. The player comes with a JavaScript API library. I couldn't find English documentation for the player, so I made a demo site that shows how it's used.

## Features
* Dynamic loading of player
* Controls: play, pause
* Progress reporting
